Final Project - CS 385
David Monteleone, Tomer Shemesh, Kelly Shiptoski

Our writeup for the entire homework can be found in CS385FinalProjectWriteUpGeneticScheduling.PDF. 

To run our program, please extract all submitted files to the same directory. Open that directory in MATLAB 2015b and type and press enter:
main

The program has the preferences and classes hardcoded into it. Feel free to mess with these values, but we suggest sticking to the classes we kept coded into the functions as these are the most interesting. The preferences and classes can be found at the top of the main.m script. The preferences need to be between 0 and 10. 10 is favorable and 0 is not. The file DownloadClasses.m contains the hardcoded quarter for which to look for the classes. Changing this is required to view other quarter classes. We suggest keeping the code as is and using the Winter Quarter 2015-2016.

Please see the submitted PDF for the final write up on our results.

Ruby DFS file(This is a section of code from the API that we implemented to do DFS. See the write up for more on this.):
RubyDFS.txt
You can't run it due to it requiring the entire API code base.
